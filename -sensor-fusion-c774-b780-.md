###  LESSON 3 : C++ Checkpoint
 - Are you ready to build Kalman Filters with C++? Take these quizzes to find out.


###  LESSON 4 : Lidar and Radar Fusion with Kalman Filters in C++
 - In this lesson, you'll build a Kalman Filter in C++ that's capable of handling data from multiple sources. Why C++? Its performance enables the application of object tracking with a Kalman Filter in real-time.


###  LESSON 5(Project) : Extended Kalman Filter Project
In this project, you'll apply everything you've learned so far about Sensor Fusion by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter in C++!

### LESSON 6 : Unscented Kalman Filters
While Extended Kalman Filters work great for linear motion, real objects rarely move linearly. With Unscented Kalman Filters, you'll be able to accurately track non-linear motion!

### LESSON 7(Project) : Unscented Kalman Filter Project
Put your skills to the test! Use C++ to code an Unscented Kalman Filter capable of tracking non-linear motion.
