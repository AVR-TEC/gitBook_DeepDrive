- LESSON 1 : Introduction and Sensors
	- Meet the team at Mercedes who will help you track objects in real-time with Sensor Fusion.
- LESSON 2 : Kalman Filters
	- Learn from the best! Sebastian Thrun will walk you through the usage and concepts of a Kalman Filter using Python.

- LESSON 3 : C++ Checkpoint
 - Are you ready to build Kalman Filters with C++? Take these quizzes to find out.
- LESSON 4 : Lidar and Radar Fusion with Kalman Filters in C++
 - In this lesson, you'll build a Kalman Filter in C++ that's capable of handling data from multiple sources. Why C++? Its performance enables the application of object tracking with a Kalman Filter in real-time.
- LESSON 5 : Extended Kalman Filter Project
 - In this project, you'll apply everything you've learned so far about Sensor Fusion by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter in C++!
- LESSON 6 : Unscented Kalman Filters
 - While Extended Kalman Filters work great for linear motion, real objects rarely move linearly. With Unscented Kalman Filters, you'll be able to accurately track non-linear motion!
- LESSON 7 : Unscented Kalman Filter Project
 - Put your skills to the test! Use C++ to code an Unscented Kalman Filter capable of tracking non-linear motion.
