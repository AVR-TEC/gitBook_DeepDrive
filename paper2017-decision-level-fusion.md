# Decision-Level Fusion

목적 
- Object detection :  performed for the localization of objects,
- Object classification : recognizes object classes from detected object regions.

In this paper, we propose a new **object-detection and classification method** using **decision-level fusion**. 

방법 
1. We fuse the classification outputs from independent unary classifiers, 
	- unary classifiers, such as 3D point clouds and image data using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
2. The unary classifiers for the two sensors are the CNN with five layers, 
	- which use more than two pre-trained convolutional layers to consider local to global features as data representation. 
3. To represent data using convolutional layers, we apply region of interest (ROI) pooling to the outputs of each layer on the object candidate regions generated using object proposal generation to realize color flattening and semantic grouping for charge-coupled device and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors.
