# MVCNN

Representation of 3D shapes for recognition에 대한 학계의 오래된 질문
-  3D Shape는 native 3D formats인 Voxel grid로 표현 해야 할까? View-based로 표현 해야 할까? ` should 3D shapes be represented with descriptors operating on their native 3D formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors?`
