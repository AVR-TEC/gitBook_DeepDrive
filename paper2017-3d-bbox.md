# Deep3DBox

목적 : 3D object detection and pose estimation from a single image

- The first network : output estimates the 3D object orientation using a novel hybrid discrete-continuous loss, which significantly outperforms the L2 loss. 

- The second : output regresses the 3D object dimensions, which have relatively little variance compared to alternatives and can often be predicted for many object types.
