# MSF-OG

Occupancy grids offer a unifying framework for multiple heterogeneous sensor integration using a probabilistic representation of sensor data.

This integration is computed through Bayesian
techniques or evidence combination approaches, both requiring
high computation workload using real number representation

In this paper, we propose a revised
theoretical formulation of multi-sensor fusion using only integer arithmetic.
