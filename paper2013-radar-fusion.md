### 1.2 Sensor Fusion

###### [ 정의 ]

Data fusion techniques combine data from multiple sensors and related information to achieve more specific inferences than could be achieved by using a single, independent sensor. [HL01]

###### [ 용어 ]

- A sensor : a device which provides information of the environment in any form of raw data. 

- Feature extraction : the process of extracting meaningful information from the raw data of a sensor
	-  e.g. points that represent corners in a camera image. 

- State estimation : the current state based on the given input, 
	- e.g. the position of a tracked vehicle

##### C. 분류 

- In [HL01] these are referenced as 
	- Data Level Fusion, 
	- Feature Level Fusion 
	- Declaration Level Fusion.
