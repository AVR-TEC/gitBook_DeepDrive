### 1.2 Sensor Fusion

#### A. 정의 

Data fusion techniques combine data from multiple sensors and related information to achieve more specific inferences than could be achieved by using a single, independent sensor. [HL01]

#### B. 분류 

- In [HL01] these are referenced as 
	- Data Level Fusion, 
	- Feature Level Fusion 
	- Declaration Level Fusion. 

In this context, a few terms have tobe defined. 

A sensor is a device which provides information of the environment inany form of raw data. 

Feature extraction is defined as the process of extractingmeaningful information from the raw data of a sensor, e.g. points that representcorners in a camera image. 

State estimation describes the current state based onthe given input, e.g. the position of a tracked vehicle
