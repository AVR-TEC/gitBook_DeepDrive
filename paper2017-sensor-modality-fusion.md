# SMF_CNN

- We present a novel end-to-end learning framework by fusing **raw pixels** from cameras and depth measurements from a **LiDAR**. 

- **A deep neural network** architecture is introduced to effectively **perform** **modality fusion** and reliably **predict steering commands** even in the presence of sensor failures. 

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fusion ofthe camera and LiDAR modalities provides further benefitsbeyond robustness to sensor failures. 

Specifically, the multimodalfused system shows a potential to navigate around staticand dynamic obstacles and to handle changes in environmentgeometry without being trained for these tasks.
